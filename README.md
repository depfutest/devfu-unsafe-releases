# Test repo: Unsafe descriptions

Disclaimer: We're not specifically picking on any of the dependencies used in this repo. The problem we're facing is an unfortunate
combination of very verbose changelogs and limitations of the APIs of GitHub we're using to generate our changelogs for display in the
Depfu pull requests.
